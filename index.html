            <h3>Introduction:</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">I come from a very small town in Ontario and was born and raised in french,
            I went to a french high-school and can now speak very fluent french and english. I chose to 
            pursue an education in software engineering since I was always very interested in my math courses
            in high-school and also loved the computer science class I took in my senior year.</p>
            <h4>My skills:</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">I am very social therefore I work well in a team. I learn new things very quickly and I am always willing to help others when they ask. Throughout my education in high-school and at Western University I've learned to code programs in c++ and in Java and work best in these languages.</p>
            <h5>My hobbies:</h5>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">I love to play sports such as basketball and volleyball. I also enjoy going to the gym. However, my favorite hobby is certainly snowboarding.</p>
            <h6>My goals</h6>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">My goal is to graduate Western University in software engineering and to be able to work for a large company such as Google or Tesla. I would also love to be able to travel the world one day.</p>
